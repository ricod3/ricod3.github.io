    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>whoami <br>whoami <br>whoami</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Rijad Bajrektarevic, I am 32 years old and I am currently attending the Coders.Bay training program at
      the Tabakfabrik, where I'd like to deepen my knowledge of Information Technology even more. <br>
      I grew up in a small town called Bad Hall (you certainly do not know, where it is located) where the main
      attraction was the park, that once won the competition for the most beautiful park in Austria. Needless to say, it
      was quite boring growing up there.
    </p>
    <p>
      9 years ago, I moved to Linz, where I got to know my wife. Now we have a four year old energetic boy who enriches
      our everyday life with a lot of action. Therefore, we visit playgrounds and parks pretty much every day or when
      the weather is not on our side, we are having a wrestlingmatch at home or go for a swim in a nearby indoor pool.
      <br>
      Generally speaking, our son is the epicenter of our life. Together we are exploring different countries or rather
      beaches which is easy with him as he loves to travel, whether by plane or car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, I also have some other hobbies as well. I am an enthusiastic athlete, although you can't tell by
      looking at me anymore because I like food just as much. I like playing football and basketball or sometimes I go
      out for a jog, just to stay vital. <br>
      I also like reading and meditating just to create a good balance between body and mind.
    </p>

    <h2>My motivation for <br>Information Technology</h2>
    <p>
      I have always been interested in Information Technology, which is why I chose Cloud Computing as the topic for my
      Matura project. At that time, I was aware that the IT industry will experience an almost exponential growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      My interest in IT was further strengthened by a training program I completed at KPMG. I have witnessed and
      experienced the IT industry to a very large extent, because we had contact with various companies/large
      enterprises and
      therefore know what the current challenges in the IT sector are. <br>
      I learned many things from messing around with Linux to building a small Cloud Setup in Microsoft Azure and
      Google Cloud Platform, where we were able to deploy our applications. While I was doing these tasks which, of
      course, took a lot of time for troubleshooting, I always thought how interesting and wide-ranging the IT industry
      really is.
    </p>
    <p>
      I always wanted to be a part of the IT sector, I always wanted to contribute something valuable to the world or at
      least to Austria and I think the best way to achieve this is to learn with and about Information Technology. This
      is what I want to do, this is where I belong.

          <h3>My OnePage Portfolio</h3>
          <p>
            Programming my own CV, which you are reading now, using HTML & CSS. This site is not online yet, but I plan
            to buy a domain as soon as this site is completely finished. <br>
            I started with the wireframe and worked myself through accordingly.

          <h3>Global DevSecOps Project</h3>
          <p>
            This project was about creating a best-practices scenario implementing SAST tools (Static Application
            Security Testing) into different CI/CD pipeline solutions such as GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline. <br>
            This was a global project within the KPMG Company to analyze the most common security integrations and later
            on to bring it to our customers.

          <h3>"Webdevelopment" for Company AS GebÃ¤udeservice</h3>
          <p>
            I successfully made and launched a small Website for the Company AS GebÃ¤udeservice e.U. By using Jimdo, a
            web construction kit, I was able to build a website within a week, considering also the fact, that I had to
            write the input on my own and researching about the industry. <br>
            The boss of the company gave me a wireframe, which I used as a template for the development.

          <h3>Marketresearch Cloud Computing</h3>
          <p>
            In 2011 me and my collegues at the HAK-Business School had a Matura project in cooperation with the Company
            FWI Information Technology GmbH. The topic was Cloud Computing and how it is going to establish in the
            future. The main task was first to inform us about Cloud Computing, what it exactly is and how is it going
            to be involved in the IT-sector. <br>
            We then surveyed small, medium and large companies about their interest in the cloud and finally evaluated
            the results.
